# Google Data Analytic Capstone Project CaseStudy 3: Follow Your Own Case Study Path

## Introduction
I am a junior data analyst working for a business intelligence consultant. I have been asked to lead a project for a brand new client â€” this will involve everything from defining the business task all the way through presenting data-driven recommendations. I will choose the topic, ask the right questions, identify a fresh dataset and ensure its integrity, conduct analysis, create compelling data visualizations, and prepare a presentation.
